# RemoteControlCodes
This application stores the codes sent by an IR remote control to electronic devices (TV, VCR etc). It cooperates with an Arduino microcontroller which receives and decodes the IR signal using a TSOP4838 IR receiver. Code information is communicated to the program by the serial port.

In addition, the application can send the stored codes to the electronic device using an IR LED connected to a digitial output of the Arduino.
